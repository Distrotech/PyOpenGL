'''OpenGL extension SGIX.blend_alpha_minmax

Overview (from the spec)
	
	Two additional blending equations are specified using the interface
	defined by EXT_blend_minmax.  These equations are similar to the
	MIN_EXT and MAX_EXT blending equations, but the outcome for all four
	color components is determined by a comparison of just the alpha
	component's source and destination values.  These equations are useful
	in image processing and advanced shading algorithms.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
