'''OpenGL extension SGIX.shadow_ambient

Overview (from the spec)
	
	This extension allows a value other than 0.0 to be returned by the
	SGIX_shadow operation in the case when the shadow test passes.
	With this extension any floating point value in the range [0.0,
	1.0] can be returned as the texture value when an object is in
	shadow.  This allows the (untextured) ambient lighting and direct
	shadowed lighting from a single light source to be computed in a
	single pass.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
	http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/SGIX/shadow_ambient.txt
