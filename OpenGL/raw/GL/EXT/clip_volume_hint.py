'''OpenGL extension EXT.clip_volume_hint

Overview (from the spec)
	
	EXT_clip_volume_hint provides a mechanism for applications to
	indicate that they do not require clip volume clipping for
	primitives. It allows applications to maximize performance in
	situations where they know that clipping is unnecessary.
	EXT_clip_volume_hint is only an indication, though, and
	implementations are free to ignore it.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
	http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/EXT/clip_volume_hint.txt
