'''OpenGL extension NV.texture_expand_normal

Overview (from the spec)
	
	This extension provides a remapping mode where unsigned texture
	components (in the range [0,1]) can be treated as though they
	contained signed data (in the range [-1,+1]).  This allows
	applications to easily encode signed data into unsigned texture
	formats.
	
	The functionality of this extension is nearly identical to the
	EXPAND_NORMAL_NV remapping mode provided in the NV_register_combiners
	extension, although it applies even if register combiners are used.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
	http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/NV/texture_expand_normal.txt
