'''OpenGL extension NV.texture_compression_vtc

Overview (from the spec)
    
    This extension adds support for the VTC 3D texture compression
    formats, which are analogous to the S3TC texture compression formats,
    with the addition of some retiling in the Z direction.  VTC has the
    same compression ratio as S3TC and uses 4x4x1, 4x4x2, or 4x4x4
    blocks.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/NV/texture_compression_vtc.txt
