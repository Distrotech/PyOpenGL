'''OpenGL extension NV.texture_shader2

Overview (from the spec)
    
    This extension extends the NV_texture_shader functionality to
    support texture shader operations for 3D textures.
    
    See the NV_texture_shader extension for information about the
    texture shader operational model.
    
    The two new texture shader operations are:
    
    <conventional textures>
    
    22.  TEXTURE_3D - Accesses a 3D texture via (s/q,t/q,r/q).
    
    <dot product textures>
    
    23.  DOT_PRODUCT_TEXTURE_3D_NV - When preceded by two DOT_PRODUCT_NV
         programs in the previous two texture shader stages, computes a
         third similar dot product and composes the three dot products
         into (s,t,r) texture coordinate set to access a 3D non-projective
         texture.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
