'''OpenGL extension MESA.pack_invert

Overview (from the spec)
    
    This extension adds a new pixel storage parameter to indicate that
    images are to be packed in top-to-bottom order instead of OpenGL's
    conventional bottom-to-top order.  Only pixel packing can be
    inverted (i.e. for glReadPixels, glGetTexImage, glGetConvolutionFilter,
    etc).
    
    Almost all known image file formats store images in top-to-bottom
    order.  As it is, OpenGL reads images from the frame buffer in
    bottom-to-top order.  Thus, images usually have to be inverted before
    writing them to a file with image I/O libraries.  This extension
    allows images to be read such that inverting isn't needed.
