'''OpenGL extension EXT.blend_logic_op

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.EXT.blend_logic_op to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	A single additional blending equation is specified using the interface
	defined by EXT_blend_minmax.  This equation is a simple logical
	combination of the source and destination colors, where the specific
	logical operation is as specified by LogicOp.  While only the XOR
	operation may find wide application, the generality of full logical
	operations is allowed.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/blend_logic_op.txt
