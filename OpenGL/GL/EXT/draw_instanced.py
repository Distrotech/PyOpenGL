'''OpenGL extension EXT.draw_instanced

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.EXT.draw_instanced to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	This extension provides the means to render multiple instances of
	an object with a single draw call, and an "instance ID" variable
	which can be used by the vertex program to compute per-instance
	values, typically an object's transform.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/draw_instanced.txt
