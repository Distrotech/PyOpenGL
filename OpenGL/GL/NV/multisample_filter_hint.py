'''OpenGL extension NV.multisample_filter_hint

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.NV.multisample_filter_hint to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	OpenGL multisampling typically assumes that the samples of a given
	pixel are weighted uniformly and averaged to compute the pixel's
	resolved color.  This extension provides a hint that permits
	implementations to provide an alternative method of resolving the
	color of multisampled pixels.
	
	As an example of such an alternative method, NVIDIA's GeForce3 GPU
	provides a technique known as Quincunx filtering.  This technique
	is used in two-sample multisampling, but it blends the pixel's two
	samples and three additional samples from adjacent pixels.  The sample
	pattern is analogous to the 5 pattern on a die.  The quality of this
	technique is widely regarded as comparable to 4 sample multisampling.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
