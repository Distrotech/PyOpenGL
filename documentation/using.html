<h1>Using&nbsp;OpenGL in Python<br>







</h1>







<p class="introduction">This document describes how to get started
using OpenGL from Python, particularly using the&nbsp;PyOpenGL 3.x
package from pyopengl.sourceforge.net. &nbsp;This document assumes
familiarity some familiarity with Python, OpenGL and Numpy (Numeric
Python).</p>





<h2>Installing the Package</h2>







<p>The PyOpenGL package uses the "SetupTools" package, which is a new,
common mechanism for distributing and installing Python packages.
&nbsp;It is quite likely that Python developers will already have
setuptools installed on their system. &nbsp;If you do not have it
installed, download and run <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py">ez_setup.py</a>. &nbsp;If you want to install
your Python egg files in a non-standard location be sure to setup your
.pydistutils.cfg to support this before installing the packages.</p>


<p class="technical">Note that you will want to uninstall any PyOpenGL
2.x or OpenGL-3.0.0a4 installation before attempting to install. The
3.0.0a4 release used the undecorated name in a misguided attempt to
make things "simpler". &nbsp;The 3.0.0a5 and beyond packages use the
same name as all previous PyOpenGL packages, "PyOpenGL".</p>




<p>Once you have setuptools installed (many Python developers already
will have it), simply issue the command:</p>





<pre>easy_install PyOpenGL</pre>





<p>To have setuptools lookup the current version of the PyOpenGL package,
download and install it. &nbsp;If
setuptools fails to install the package, you may need to update your
setuptools. &nbsp;Or you can try a direct download of the package with
this command in the directory where you downloaded the package:</p>




<pre>easy_install -f . PyOpenGL</pre>




<p>If you do not have administrative
permissions on your machine, you can create a .pydistutils.cfg file in
your home directory to tell setuptools where to install new .egg files.</p>


<p>To update your install to the latest release of PyOpenGL:</p>


<pre>easy_install -U PyOpenGL<br></pre>


<p>Which will search for the latest registered version of the package and install that on your system.</p>


<p class="technical">If you use setuptools to package your application,
you should declare a dependency on "PyOpenGL" to pull in the latest
PyOpenGL 3.x release.</p>





<p>As of 3.0.0a3&nbsp;PyOpenGL&nbsp;is dependant on the setuptools
package.&nbsp; You cannot run without the setuptools support, as it is
used to provide the plugin mechanism used by array data-type plugin
mechanism. &nbsp;You will probably want to install <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">numpy</a> as well. &nbsp;<a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/">ctypes</a> is a dependency&nbsp;for Python 2.4 and Python 2.3 but included with Python 2.5.</p>
<h3>Win32 Dependencies</h3>
<p>PyOpenGL is a wrapper around OpenGL, GLU, GLUT (including
Free/OpenGLUT) and GLE. Most Linux and OS-X systems will have these
available or be able to install them automatically as packages.
&nbsp;On Win32 we need to do a bit more work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Download the <a href="http://www.xmission.com/%7Enate/glut.html">GLUT for Win32</a> package, copy&nbsp;glut32.dll to your WINDOWS/system32 directory</li>
  <li>Download the compiled <a title="Download the zip package" href="http://www.vrplumber.com/gle32.zip">GLE for Win32</a> package, copy gle32.dll to your WINDOWS/system32 directory</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://pyopengl.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/pyopengl/OpenGL-ctypes/src/win32deps.py">This script</a>
automates the process. &nbsp;Note that you will be agreeing to be bound
by the license agreements of the GLUT and GLE libraries on running the
script.</p>
<h3>Bleeding Edge Development</h3>





<p>If you are working in an area that's currently under active
development you may prefer to&nbsp;use the CVS version of the PyOpenGL
package. &nbsp;OpenGL-ctypes (the code-name for the 3.0.0 version of
PyOpenGL) is developed and
maintained within the PyOpenGL CVS repository.&nbsp; To check out
the current version of OpenGL-ctypes:</p>







<pre>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@pyopengl.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/pyopengl co -P OpenGL-ctypes<br></pre>







<p>You can install the checkout to your path for further development as
follows (from the OpenGL-ctypes checkout directory):<br>







</p>







<pre>./setupegg.py develop --install-dir=~/YOUR-WORKING-DIRECTORY-ON-PYTHONPATH-HERE<br></pre>





<p>When you make a change, run <code>cvs
diff</code> on the OpenGL-ctypes
directory to produce a patch file and <a href="mailto:mcfletch@vrplumber.com">send it to me</a>
as an attachment.&nbsp; I prefer "context" diffs (<code>cvs
diff -c</code>) for contributed
code, as it makes it easier to see where the code fits in.&nbsp;
That said, I'm happy to get code in any readily integrated format.</p>







<h2>Accessing OpenGL Functionality</h2>





<p>The OpenGL library is a singleton instance for each process that is
shared by all in-process code that uses OpenGL commands. &nbsp;Normally
you will want to use OpenGL from within a GUI framework, such as
wxPython, PyGame, Tkinter, PyGTK or PyQt. &nbsp;For stand-alone 3D
programs, you may want to use the simple, but often quite
effective,GLUT library, a wrapper for which is included in the&nbsp;PyOpenGL
package. </p>





<p>Your GUI package will generally have a way to define an OpenGL
"window" and set that window "active". &nbsp;Once the window is active,
PyOpenGL commands will render into the window (as will any commands in
the process issued from another language, such as a C extension).
&nbsp;Normally this is handled by registering a handler for "events"
from the GUI for such things are requests to display, resize, deal with
mouse movements and the like.</p>





<p>To get access to basic OpenGL functionality, you should import the
OpenGL.GL and OpenGL.GLU packages. &nbsp;This is normally done with
global imports [XXX show multi-version-install usage as well]:</p>





<pre>from OpenGL.GL import *<br>from OpenGL.GLU import *<br></pre>





<p>If you want to access functions in an extension module, you can load the extensions via a similar import:</p>





<pre>from OpenGL.GL.ARB.shader_objects import *<br>from OpenGL.GL.ARB.fragment_shader import *<br>from OpenGL.GL.ARB.vertex_shader import *</pre>





<p>It's a good idea to use the initialisation functions in the
extension modules to check that the extension is available on the
current machine before using any of the functions in the extension
(note: calling the init functions was a requirement in PyOpenGL 2.x).
&nbsp;For example:</p>





<pre>if not glInitShaderObjectsARB():<br>	raise RuntimeError( <br>		"""ARB Shader Objects extension is required """<br>		"""but not supported on this machine!""" <br>	)<br></pre>





<p>or more reasonably, to trigger the use of fallback code for the missing functionality from the extension.</p>





<h3>API Changes from C-level OpenGL</h3>





<p>Generally speaking,&nbsp;PyOpenGL 3.x tries to be compatible with the
PyOpenGL 2.x series, which tried to provide a "Pythonic" interface to
OpenGL. &nbsp;This includes providing support for implying various
arguments, such as the dimensions of arrays from array's declaration of
their dimensions. &nbsp;The online <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/ctypes/pydoc/OpenGL.html">pydoc documentation</a>provides
the most accurate (because it is auto-generated), though
somewhat confusing, reference to the API as provided by PyOpenGL.
&nbsp;We will be revising that documentation to be more friendly as
work progresses.</p>





<p class="technical">If you are updating from PyOpenGL 2.x, see the&nbsp;<a href="#upgrading">Upgrading</a> section below.</p>





<h3>Error Handling</h3>







<p>As with previous versions of
PyOpenGL,&nbsp;PyOpenGL 3.x tries to follow Python's</p>







<p class="introduction">Errors
should never pass silently. </p>







<p>philosophy, rather than
OpenGL's philosophy of always requiring explicit checks for error
conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;PyOpenGL functions run the function <code>OpenGL.error.glCheckError</code>
after each function call.&nbsp; This function is glBegin/glEnd
aware, that is, the glBegin and glEnd functions enable and disable the
checking of errors (because error checking doesn't work between those
calls).</p>





<p class="technical">If you call C-level glBegin/glEnd the error
checking may become confused. &nbsp;You should explicitly disable error
checking (described below) in such a case.</p>







<p>You can override the error-handler, either to provide your own
custom functionality, or to disable checking entirely. &nbsp;Error
checking can be entirely disabled by the following code (before
importing anything from the OpenGL namespace, i.e. as the first thing
your top-level script does):</p>
<pre>import OpenGL<br>OpenGL.ERROR_CHECKING = False</pre>
<p>This should <strong>only</strong> be done by applications, never by
libraries, as disabling error checking entirely makes it much harder to
debug a PyOpenGL application.</p>
<p>You can also customise the error-checking functionality rather than disabling it, for
instance, if you will always have a valid context, you could register
the raw glGetError function as the error checker to avoid the overhead
of the context-validity checks:</p>







<pre>from OpenGL import error<br>error.ErrorChecker.registerChecker( myAlternateFunction )</pre>







<p>OpenGL-ctypes has a set of
errors defined in the <a href="pydoc/OpenGL.error.html"><code>OpenGL.error</code></a>
module.&nbsp; It can also raise standard Python exceptions, such as
ValueError or TypeError.&nbsp; Finally, it can raise ctypes errors
when argument conversion fails. (XXX that's sub-optimal, it has
implementation details poking out to user code).<br>







</p>







<p>Wrapper objects catch OpenGL
errors and annotate the error with extra information to make it easier
to debug failures during the wrapping process.</p>





<h3>Tkinter (Legacy GUI) Togl
Support</h3>







<p>We have included the Python
wrapper for the Tk Togl widget in the OpenGL-ctypes package.&nbsp;
We do not, however, currently include the Togl widget itself.&nbsp;
If you would like to use Togl in your package, please use your system's
package manager to install the Togl package (or compile from
source).&nbsp; You may have to recompile Python with Tk support as
well.</p>







<h2><a name="Performance"></a>Performance Tips for Python + OpenGL</h2>





<p>Python is (currently) a fairly slow language due to the incredible
generality of it's execution model. &nbsp;This means that certain
approaches to coding OpenGL that would work well in a language such a C
or C++ will be painfully slow in Python. &nbsp;The key idea to remember
is that, as much as possible, you want to push the work of iteration
and repetition into the OpenGL implementation (which is implemented in
C and/or Hardware).</p>





<p>There are two major approaches taken to accomplishing this:</p>





<ul>





  <li>Use array-based geometry</li>





  <li>Use display-lists</li>





</ul>





<p>Array based geometry uses OpenGL 1.1 features (supported almost
everywhere) that allow for passing large arrays of data to be processed
with a single call. &nbsp;Using numpy (or Numeric) arrays, you can
readily pass your data into those functions without any need for
Python-level iteration. &nbsp;This is the more flexible of the two
approaches, as it allows for readily mutating the data being rendered
without heavy recompilation costs and allows for special effects such
as translucency. &nbsp;For static geometry, however, the display-list
approach may be faster.</p>





<p>Display-list geometry normally uses slower individual-element
rendering functions to render a piece of geometry in a special OpenGL
mode which records the commands used to do the rendering. &nbsp;In
future rendering passes the geometry can be rendered with a single
call. &nbsp;You can create trees of display lists (where a root display
list calls dozens of other display-lists) or call multiple display
lists at once from an array.</p>





<h3>Avoiding Array-data Copying</h3>





<p>One of the biggest slowdowns you will see in array-based PyOpenGL code is where you are passing:</p>





<ul>





  <li> a compatible but inexactly matching array data-type</li>





  <li>a non-contiguous array (one which is not stored as a simple data-pointer)</li>





</ul>





<p>In these cases PyOpenGL implementation&nbsp;will cause an extra copy
of the data-set every time it is passed into any function. &nbsp;That
copying, though done at the C level, can cause a signficant unnecessary
overhead.</p>





<p class="technical">The copying is done by default to prevent new
OpenGL coders from being confronted by mystifying errors about
differences between "floats" and "double floats". &nbsp;It also makes
PyOpenGL 3.x compatible with the PyOpenGL 2.x series.</p>





<p>PyOpenGL 3.x provides a flag that allows you to raise Errors
in&nbsp;situations where numpy data-arrays are being copied. &nbsp;You
can use these error messages to optimise your application data-paths to
eliminate the copying.To enable the checking do the following before any other OpenGL imports: </p>





<pre>import OpenGL<br>OpenGL.ERROR_ON_COPY = True<br></pre>





<p>This will raise errors of the type:</p>





<pre>OpenGL.error.CopyError<br></pre>





<p>With a description of the condition and why the copy was to be done.</p>





<h3>Context-specific Data</h3>







<p>Because of the way OpenGL and
ctypes handle, for instance, pointers, to array data, it is often
necessary to ensure that a Python data-structure is retained (i.e. not
garbage collected).&nbsp; This is done by storing the data in an
array of data-values that are indexed by a context-specific
key.&nbsp; The functions to provide this functionality are provided
by the <a href="pydoc/OpenGL.contextdata.html"><code>OpenGL.contextdata</code></a>
module.</p>







<p class="technical">The
key that is used to index the storage array is provided by the platform
module's <code>GetCurrentContext()</code>
function.&nbsp; The current context is used if the context argument
is passed in as <code>None</code>.<br>







</p>







<p>If you are creating and destroying rendering contexts, you need to
be aware of the Context-specific storage. &nbsp;If you do not
explicitly clean up the storage, you will produce a memory leak of all
of the objects passed in as array data-sources and the like. &nbsp;You
can either explicitly set the values to None (the standard OpenGL
approach), or use code like the following:</p>





<pre>from OpenGL import contextdata<br>def cleanupCallback( context=None ):<br>	"""Create a cleanup callback to clear context-specific storage for the current context"""<br>	def callback( context = contextdata.getContext( context ) ):<br>		"""Clean up the context, assumes that the context will *not* render again!"""<br>		contextdata.cleanupContext( context )<br>	return callback</pre>





<p>registering the callback to be called after the context is destroyed.</p>





<p class="technical">It is very important that you call the cleanup
operation after the context is destroyed, as any attempt to render the
context after the cleanup call will almost certainly result in
memory-access errors and potentially core dumps!</p>





<h2>Get Involved</h2>





<p>PyOpenGL is an Open Source project, and PyOpenGL 3.x is written in
Python to allow Python coders to enhance the package. &nbsp;If you see
something that's wrong, or something that you'd like to fix, let people
know, or fix it and send a patch. &nbsp;We have <a href="development.html">documentation</a> for those who are interested in contributing that should help you get started hacking on the code-base.</p>





<h2><a name="upgrading"></a>Upgrading</h2>





<p>PyOpenGL 3.x tries to be API-compatible with PyOpenGL 2.x as much as
possible, but there are some differences that need to be considered
when porting code:</p>





<ul>





  <li>setuptools required</li><ul><li>You *must* run
setuptools installation in order to register the egg entry points, if
you do not you will have *no* data formats supported and nothing will
work at all</li></ul><li>numpy versus Numeric</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>PyOpenGL 2.x used (only) the older "Numeric" module.
&nbsp;PyOpenGL 3.x can use Numeric (with an optional C extension), but
uses numpy by default.</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  </ul><li>strings deprecated as array return-types for all save image data</li><ul><li>PyOpenGL
2.x would normally return your GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE data as strings.
&nbsp;We continue to support this for image operations (glGetTexImage,
glReadPixels), but we provide a way to turn off the behaviour and
receive your configured Numpy/Ctypes return data-type for your
image-data queries (OpenGL.UNSIGNED_BYTE_IMAGES_AS_STRING)</li></ul>





  <li>different error types</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>In a number of locations PyOpenGL 3.x will raise a different
error type than PyOpenGL 2.x [XXX document which cases, at minimum
every ctypes-level error is new (and should be eliminated, likely)]</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>





  <li>no "contiguous" function</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>This function was provided to allow users to force a Numeric
array to be a contiguous data-structure. &nbsp;Given that PyOpenGL 3.x
is polyglot with regard to Numeric modules, it does not provide the
function any more. &nbsp;See the vrml.array <a href="http://pyopengl.cvs.sourceforge.net/pyopengl/vrml/arrays.py?view=markup">module</a>'s contiguous function for an example of how to write your own such function.</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  </ul><li>Togl support is deprecated/unsupported</li><ul><li>Togl can be installed from the resurrected Togl project on SourceForge. &nbsp;We continue to distribute the wrapper.</li></ul><li>Performance decrease</li><ul><li>The new architecture, while far more flexible than PyOpenGL 2.x is far slower than the C-coded version 2.x.</li><li>Getting
around this is pretty much "more of the same", i.e. use display lists
and arrays (preferably Vertex-buffer objects) religously (See <a href="#performance">Performance Tips</a> above)</li></ul>





  <li>[XXX there's more, I'm sure]</li>





</ul>
